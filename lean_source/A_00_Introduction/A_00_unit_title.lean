CS6501 Spring 2023
==================

We are at the beginning of an exciting era of formalization of abstract
mathematics by and for working mathematicians. The driving hypothesis of
behind this tome is that that work is getting to a point where computer
science can begin to use it to achieve breakthroughs in the specification
of semantic domains with rich mathematical structure, wherever they might 
be needed.

This tome comprises course notes, still rough, from an entry-level graduate 
course the aim of which was to enable students to pursue research exploring
this idea. Undergraduate education of CS students in precise formal thought 
lags far behind that needed to prepare students for research in this area.

A major assumption behind the design of this course is thus that many students
will need to learn logic, proof, and richer mathematical abstractions. It's in
the topics that then build on this foundation that this tome diverges from some
others those targeting computer scientists. 

The second major part of the course aims to teach students about how we can
formalize basic abstract abstract structures. An assumption behind the design
of this second part of the course is that students should can learn well from
running concrete examples that make it clear how abstract mathematics capture
a domain of interest. 

The current state of the notes is still a bit rough. The last section 
of the last chapter is still under construction.
