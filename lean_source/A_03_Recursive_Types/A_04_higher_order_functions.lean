Higher-Order Functions
**********************

You've been seeing higher-order functions from early
in this class. Consider the semantic evaluation function
for (our representations of) expressions in propositional
logic. It takes as arguments an expression, *e*, and an 
"interpretation," *i,* in the form of a specific function 
from propositional variables to logical truth values.

Higher-order functions are simply functions that consume
function definitions as arguments and/or return function
definitions as results. There are a few classic higher-order
functions on lists, including *map*, *fold*, and *filter*
that we'll meet along the way.
