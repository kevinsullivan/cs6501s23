`affine_space <https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/linear_algebra/affine_space/basic.html>`_

In this section we'll make sense of the statement that an 
affine space is just a torsor whose action/difference set
is not just a group or module but a vector space. That means
we can add and subtract actions and we have scalar multiplication
by fractional scalars. Differences between torsor points will
now be vectors in a vector space, which operate on points, 
in turn, additively, by *translating* them. 

In Lean, *affine_space V P*, where *V* is the type of
vectors and P is the torsor of points, is just another 
notation for *add_torsor V P* where the action set, V, 
will have the structure of a vector space.
