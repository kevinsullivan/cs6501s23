A predicate, as we've seen, is a function from objects to propositions
*about* them. For example, the predicate, *is_even := Î» n, n % 2 = 0* 
is a function that takes a natural number, *n*, and yields a proposition
*about n*, namely that that particular value, *n*, modulo *2*, is equal
to zero: *n % 2 = 0*.
