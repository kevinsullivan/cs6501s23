Until this point in this class, we've
worked mostly "in Prop" (with propositions
and proofs). That makes sense because we 
were studying inference in predicate logic.

We still are, but now that we know basic
reasoning principles, we're going to home
in on *functions* as another essential part 
of predicate logic. 

Predicate logic supports function symbols 
in proposition expressions and application
of function expressions, where functions are 
applied to arguments to compute results. 

Lean is a sophsticated functional language
as well as a proof assistant. It provides the 
means to name, define, and apply functions
and to compute their return values. It's
remarkable to have such an environment in 
which to both program and reason.
